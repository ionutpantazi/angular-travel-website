# AngularTravelWebsite
This demo shows an example website of a POI location map around Oxford's city center. It's a simple single page app build in Angular using api to render a map containing 7 locations. When a user clicks a location the map will 'fly' to a new set of coordinates (lat/lng literals), add a marker and a popup.
